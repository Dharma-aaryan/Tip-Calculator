# Tip-Calculator

My First Flutter App: This app calculates tips based on the total bill amount and percentage of tip. The app includes use of basic widgets that I have learned over the period of 4 hours and also takes in input from the user. The app should run smoothly however, it might show an error in the gradle file in the android section which can be ignored and will not be of any hindrance at all.

Since this was my first flutter app and I started learning along the way without any plan and still in the learning stage so, I have taken help from a pre existing code on codepen.com where this code is available for everyone.

Check the link to view the code on Codepen.com and you can also try it out on the online compiler and run this app as well.
